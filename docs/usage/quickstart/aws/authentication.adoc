==== Authentication

In order for Terraform to deploy to AWS, it needs to credentials. These are supplied as environment variables:

- AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID
- AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY
- AWS_REGION

The following examples assume that the access keys used are the ones that belong to the IAM user. If additional keys are required please refer to https://docs.aws.amazon.com/IAM/latest/UserGuide/id_credentials_access-keys.html[Managing AccessKeys for IAM Users]

Once the key have been retrieved set the values for the environment variables as shown above.
