=== Stage Environment Variables

The main bulk of configuration for AIR is achieved using environment variables. This is a great way to keep secrets secret and to provide a dynamic system to change the build parameters without changing the process. However the downside is that it is not easy to discover what those environment variables should be.

The repo contains a file that informs the pipeline system what environment variables are required for each stage and cloud platform combination. The file is located at `<REPO_ROOT>/build/config/stage_envvars.yml`. A snippet of this file is shown below:

[source,yaml]
----
include::../../build/config/stage_envvars.yml[lines=1..35]
...
----

The `default` variables are those that are to be available for any stage. The credentials are selected based on the cloud that has been specified. The list of variables is generated from the default ones as well as any that have been specified under the selected `stage`.

The credentials section contains a list of the necessary environment variables for the chosen cloud. These variables are required for authentication.

The table below details the variable object that is set as an item in any variables array.

.Variable object parameters
[options="header",cols="1,3,^1"]
|===
| Name | Description | Required
| `name` | Name of the environment variable | icon:check-circle[]
| `description` | Description of what the variable is for. This is displayed in any "missing" output as well as 
generated script files | icon:times-circle[]
| `cloud` | Specifies that the variable is only required for that cloud platform.

If not specified it is assumed to be for all cloud platforms for that stage. | icon:times-circle[]

NOTE: Whilst the tool checks that all the environment variables are available to the pipeline, it itself needs to have the `STAGE` and `CLOUD_PLATFORM` specified to accurately determine what environment variables are required.

If the task is run without the `STAGE` and `CLOUD_PLATFORM` variable the output will be very minimal:

[source,bash]
----
taskctl setup:environment

IMPORTANT: This repository uses InSpec to perform tests against the cloud resources. Although it is available under the Apache licence its license must be accepted in the container. This has *not* been accepted by default and if this is not set InSpec will raise an error when those tasks are executed.

Now if the command is run again after the missing environment variables have been set the output is much more informative. In this case the terraform state templates are being targeted, these are the templates that configure the remote state storage for Ensono Stacks.

This task is run anywhere that the main pipeline is run so this will be displayed if the necessary environment variables for do not exist. This can be very helpful when debugging SaaS based pipelines.

The next section shows how this information can be used ot create a stub script file for configuring a local environment.
