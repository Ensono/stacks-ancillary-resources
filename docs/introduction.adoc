== Introduction

This repository contains the Terraform templates and tests that are required to setup the initial infrastructure for running Amido stacks.

There are two templates:

1. Storage creation for the Terraform state
2. Resources that allow Amido Stacks to work, such as DNS zones and Log Analytics

The reason that these two things have been changed is so that the state for the main resources can be saved in the state storage. Previous versions of the repository configured everything at one time so the state of the resources was not being saved anywhere.

THe only exception now is that the storage account state is not being saved in the remote storage, but this would create a circular dependency whereby the state would be looked for in the storage which had not yet been created by the templates.
